        <h3>
                The Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15 (Russian: Микоян-Гуревич МиГ-15;
                 USAF/DoD designation: 
                Type 14; NATO reporting name: Fagot) is a jet fighter aircraft
                 developed by Mikoyan-Gurevich for the Soviet Union.
                 The MiG-15 was one of the first successful jet fighters to incorporate 
                 swept wings to achieve high transonic speeds. 
                 In aerial combat during the Korean War, it outclassed straight-winged 
                 jet day fighters, 
                 which were largely relegated to ground-attack roles.
                  In response to the MiG-15's appearance and in order to counter it,
                the United States Air Force rushed the North American F-86 Sabre to Korea.
                When refined into the more advanced MiG-17,
                 the basic design would again surprise the West when it proved
                 effective against supersonic fighters such as the Republic F-105 
                 Thunderchief and McDonnell Douglas F-4
                  Phantom II in the Vietnam War of the 1960s.
                The MiG-15 is believed to have been one of the
                 most produced jet aircraft with more than 13,000 manufactured.
                The MiG-15 remains in service with the Korean People's Army AirForce
                 as an advanced trainer.
